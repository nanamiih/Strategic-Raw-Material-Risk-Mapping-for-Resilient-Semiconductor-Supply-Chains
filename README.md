# Strategic Raw Material Risk Mapping for Resilient Semiconductor Supply Chains
**Industry-Sponsored Capstone Project (NDA Protected)**

## Overview
This capstone project develops an **upstream supply chain risk analytics framework** for a global manufacturing environment.  
The project focuses on improving visibility into multi-tier supplier networks and assessing structural risks across geopolitical, supply, financial, sustainability, and human rights dimensions.

Due to a **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**, this repository does **not** contain source code, raw data, dashboards, or proprietary company information. Only high-level project descriptions and a final presentation poster are shared.

## Project Goal
- Build a **scalable and structured framework** to identify upstream supply chain risks across critical materials  
- Enhance **early risk identification** for sourcing and continuity planning  
- Support **data-driven sourcing and sustainability decisions** through consolidated risk insights  

## Key Variables
The analysis integrates multiple categories of upstream risk indicators, including:

- **Geopolitical & Country Risk**
  - Country concentration
  - Trade exposure
  - Regulatory and governance environment  

- **Supply Chain Structure**
  - Multi-tier supplier mapping (Tier-1 to upstream tiers)
  - Dependency and concentration risk  

- **Financial Risk**
  - Liquidity and solvency indicators
  - Financial stability metrics  

- **Sustainability & Human Rights**
  - Environmental risk indicators
  - Social and human rights indices  

## Key Outcomes
- A **unified upstream risk framework** consolidating multiple risk dimensions into a single analytical view  
- A **scalable supplier tier-mapping methodology** designed for expansion to additional materials and scenarios  
- Clear **decision logic and escalation pathways** connecting risk signals to sourcing and mitigation actions  
- A **decision-support poster** highlighting concentration analysis, country-level vulnerability, and strategic sourcing implications  

## Data & Confidentiality Notice
- All underlying data, models, dashboards, and implementation details are **confidential**  
- No proprietary information, datasets, or code are disclosed in this repository
